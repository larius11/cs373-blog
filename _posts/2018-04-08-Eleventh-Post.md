title: Integrate Testing... First.
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week most of my time was spent working on projects and homeworks for other classes since we had already finished the funcitonalities of our website last week. I also spent it trying to plan ahead for the rest of the semester since it is coming to a close pretty soon. 

## What is in my way?
CUrrently in my way is final projects that all need to be tied up at the same time. I've got a research paper that needs to be planned out and finished in the coming weeks as well as lots of studying for the last exams that are coming up for all my classes. Also, my group and I were not able to implement testing on our current production of the website so the hurdles of figuring out why it would not compile or run properly is something currently in our way.

## What will I do next week?
Next week the plan is to fully integrate testing into our project and to get whatever comes with next phase done quickly so that we can focus on work for our other classes for the last couple weeks. We are also hopeful to maybe start working on the final presentation for our website. 

## What is my experience of the class?
So far my experience of the class has been great, the more of the semester that goes by the more I am realizing that I am learning more than I expected to. I am certainly liking the last part of the semester much better than the first couple ones. I enjoy learning about SQL since I have not had a class on that yet and it seems like an essential tool for any software developer. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be to not get cocky if you have finished most of the work for a particular project. My team and I made that mistake this time around and were not able to fully integrate testing for our project. This would not have happened had we spend more time working on the finishing touches before Thursday.

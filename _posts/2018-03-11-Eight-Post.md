## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent it finishing up the last tests before Spring Break and doing as much as I could of the project. My group and I met a couple times to clear up what needed to be done before going into a week of no school to ensure that we finished all of the chunk of work before we come back and have to stress about wrapping up the few little things before turning in. I have also been trying to catch up on laundry and all other regular life things so that I can actually relax and take some time off during Spring Break.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is a mountain of household work that I want to tackle before Wednesday at the very least. After that I would also like to catch up on some sleep so my own battle between sleep and spending time with friends or playing game is in some weird way in my way. Hopefully I can take care of everything on time so that I can also finish up my section of the project before we come back from break.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I am going to finish those household duties, finish up my section of the project, spend some time with friends, and eventually catch up on the sleep that I have been missing throughout the semester. Maybe, just maybe, I can get ahead on some projects for other classes so that I do not stress over it throughout the week when we come back.

## What is my experience of the class?
So far my experience of the class has been quite rewarding. Most of the things that Professor Downing has brought up about Python have been popping up on the database code for our project and has been helpful during debugging. I am thankful that we get to experience every facet of making a functional database-driven website from a course at school. I feel like I am actually practicing for what I might be doing in industry.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week is something that I should apply to my own life as well. Relax when you can! I usually have to go to school in the morning and then work until 10pm and also work on weekends so having actual time to relax feels weird and I have to find a way to keep myself occupied by finding work to do or start new projects. As much fun and rewarding as that can be, relaxing and unplugging is necessary as well. During this Spring Break spend some time outside, or talk to a friend you have not talked to in a while.

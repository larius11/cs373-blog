title: Tests are upon us.

## What did I do this past week?
This past week I have been spending it working on figuring out the Flask-Restless extension in order to be able to manage the database required for our class project. I have also been hacking away at Debugging and Verification projects and homework so that I can get ahead and not have to worry about that class for the entirety of this week. I have also started my new responsibilities at work that required me to miss class on Friday and of course, it was the one day that I was called on to answer a question in class. 

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is time and work. I have two tests this week and one lab due in my Concurrency class. This is going to be a very busy week with lots of organization required. As I seem to get further into the school year I am finding it much more difficult to keep up with all of the labs and getting everything done on time. I am taking some time off from work this week so that I can make sure I am caught up on all of my assignments. With this said, I have a lot of work to catch up on.

## What will I do next week?
This coming week the plan is to spend most of my time studying after finishing up projects for all my classes. With two tests this week everything is feeling really stressful so ensuring that I get some rest and a good amount of sleep is going to be vital to maintaining my sanity this week. I have fallen behind on the reading so I am going to have to make sure I knock those out after the test so that I can better set up the database for the group project. I have figure out the overall semantics of Flask-Restless, and the overall schema for how our database is to be set up. It is a matter of setting up the .py files and communicating this to my team this week.

## What is my experience of the class?
This class is starting to become stressful. There are a lot of tools that we have to pick up in a relatively short amount of time and with all my other classes and work it is proving difficult to master these tools before due dates and tests. However, I, somehow, enjoy this because it feels like I am put in a more realistic environment as far as the professional world of software engineering is concerned. Hopefully, once this class is over I will come out with a good understanding of the tools after using them for a while.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
For my tip-of-the-week, I would have to say 'relax' but stay focused. In order to help with that [here](https://youtu.be/3bhP7zulFfY) is a CS related video which is interesting and relaxing at the same time, at least for me

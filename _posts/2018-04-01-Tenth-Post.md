## What did I do this past week?
This past week my team and I spent it fixing some bugs that we had on our turn in files from the last section of the project. Once we fixed those bugs we had already started some of the requirements for the next due date. We have filtering done for all models and already had pagination finished on all model screens as well. I was also able to finish a project and some homework for other classes that needed to get done before the weekend.  

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is time, as always. With easter weekend being here there are a lot of things I had to take care of before Sunday and now I have to cram my homework for the weekend before Monday. I thankfully got Sunday off from work since it is Easter and they consider it a holiday and close down all H-E-B's. 

## What will I do next week?
Next week the plan is to have the entire project done by Tuesday since some of my group members have tests and other stuff to take care off on Wednesday and Thursday so we must finish early. I also have homework due by Wednesday so finishing the project early in order to have time for that later would be ideal. This would help me not worry about staying up and cramming all of the work that needs to be done throughout the week. 

## What is my experience of the class?
So far my experience has been quite rewarding with the project having such a wide scope of tools that we are using for it. Working in a big group has also been extremely eye-opening and I am learning alot of things about working with other people in my field.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be to COMMUNICATE. Life is crazy and things happen that can affect the flow of things but if you cannot communicate things that are happening with your group then you are doing more harm than anything else. Things happen, people will understand.

## What did I do this past week?
This past week I've spent it setting up all my projects for the various classes I am enrolled in. I have dealt with locks and synchronization in CS378 Concurrency, parsed command line arguments and environment variables in CS340D, and learned how many things can go wrong with a classroom repo in this class (CS373 Software Engineering). Thankfully, I had enough free time throughout the week to get everything going. It is now a matter of having enough time to finish everything next week. I also attended [HACS' kickoff](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/hacs/) which was really fun and I even got some neat prizes for entering a FIFA tournament they were hosting. Unfortunately, their meetings are on Tuesday evenings and it conflicts with my schedule, but hopefully, I can still attend some of their events. 

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is the logic behind [compare_exchange_strong](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/atomic/atomic/compare_exchange_strong/) and having enough time to get all my readings done. As I began setting up the projects, for each one, there were bumps in the road which required me to research something to move forward. All of them I eventually figured out except for the *compare_ exchange_strong* Within all three of my CS classes, readings are quite extensive and I seem to have to dedicate an entire day just for reading to make sure I stay on top of things. With a full-time job, this has proven to be quite the challenge. At least the textbooks are interesting and are helping to keep my mentality on the right plane as far as programming is concerned.

## What will I do next week?
Next week my hope is to finish all of the labs I am currently working on and be able to finish up the readings ahead of time. I also want to put into my schedule some time for creating an online calendar that I actually use. I am beginning to feel overwhelmed with everything going on in my life and feel the need to see some organization happen. Perhaps I will give Google Calendar a try if anyone has some suggestions I am open to hearing them out. I just ask that it can be used on an iPhone, it doesn't necessarily need to sync to my computer. 

## What is my experience of the class? 
So far my experience of the class is similar to the experience I had in OOP with Downing. The quizzes at the beginning of class are something I am getting good at and they certainly don't make me as nervous as they did the first time I had to do one during the previous semester. I am only worried about finding a good team for the final project, I am curious as to when we will further discuss the assignment. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
For my **tip-of-the-week** I have this online [Markdown Editor](https://dillinger.io/) that works well enough for when I want to double check that my post is looking just how I want it to and ensure that I haven't mistyped something before pushing it to my online repo. I also use [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for when I forget how to do something in Markdown. Both useful when putting a good README.md together.

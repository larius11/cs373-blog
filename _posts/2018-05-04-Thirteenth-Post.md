## What did you like the least about the class?
Something I did not particularly like about this class was how disconnected the waht to do and how to do it can be. There are so many different ways and techs to use in order to create what is needed the group project and in the end there are a few that make the overall project easier and still let you learn what I believe is intended to be portrayed by the course.

## What did you like the most about the class?
What I liked most about this course is what we actually got out of it in the sense of actual meaningful work for a portfolio. This class made my resume and overall ability to carry out a professional conversation about what I want to do much more solid. 

## What's the most significant thing you learned?
I believe the most significant thing that I learned was the importance of keeping the connection between front end and back end solid. By this I mean that even though they are two different parts of a project they need to understand what the other is doing in order to complete its duty accordingly. Constant communication between all sections of a project is key to success. 

## How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?
I would say on average about 30 hours a week. 

## How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?
Somewhere between 4-8 hours. 

## How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
Definitely broke the 2,000 lines mark. Although, I worked on the back-end and back-end code can be somewhat repetitive in the sense of structure.

## What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
Even though I do not enjoy using it much, React is a powerful tool that makes front end development streamlined. However, tt can be confusing if packages get out of control.

## What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
This [website](https://flatuicolors.com/) was useful when refactoring the front end and making the website look more modern. 

## If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
I think the overall tools and packages should be more nailed down. It is nice to see groups making different and varied website so maybe give room for people to use different packages but provide more solid guidance as to what all the packages are going to need to do together.

title: Easier Than Expected.

## What did I do this past week?
This past week I have been spending it researching SQLAlchemy and Flask in general. I also had my first test in this class on Thursday. It definitely went much better than I expected. Last semester when I took Object Oriented Programming with Professor Downing I always did poorly on Hacker Rank. However, with all of the time that we have spent on exercises during class, I was more comfortable using Hacker Rank and was able to answer and pass all of the questions. Hopefully I can do just as well on the second exam. 

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is tests in other classes. I have two tests coming up this week and not enough time to study for both of them. My team and I are also trying to stay ahead of the game with our website but we keep hitting bumps in the road that are impeding us from moving forward. Hopefully, while keeping up with my studying for other tests, we can overcome the issues and finish the project before Spring Break. 

## What will I do next week?
Next week the plan is to communicate efficiently with my team as to when I'll be available and how much I can do in my spare time throughout the week. Since some of the people in our group are leaving for Spring Break on Friday it is imperative that we get together and finish some stuff by Thursday to ensure that we are ahead of the game. I am also planning on squeezing in some studying so that I can perform well in the tests coming up this week. 

## What is my experience of the class?
My experience of this class is that budgeting time to understand what each section of our group is supposed to be taking care of is imperative to finishing sub sections of the project. It is not the best choice to have one person understand every little detail of every section. It is more rewarding and efficient to make sure that at least one person understands one section really well so that it is taken care of well. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would have to align with my answer to the previous question. Project Boards are imperative to the success of the team. If responsibilities are not laid out and no one is sure of what it is they are supposed to be doing, then nothing will get done. Divide and Conquer!

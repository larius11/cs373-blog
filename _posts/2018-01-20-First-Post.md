title: Waitlists are for waiting.

## What are my expectations of this class?
For this class, I am hoping to come out with a better understanding of the process of developing software. That is, the planning, the teamwork required, the challenges and how to handle them in order to meet deadlines and deliver a quality product. From my experience in professor Downing's Object-Oriented Programming class, I have high hopes for the quality of the course. 

## What did I do this past week?
This past week I have spent it sitting on a waitlist until yesterday (01/19/2018).  I did not know whether or not I would be taking this class this semester. I am glad that I managed to get a spot, however, I am also taking 2 other CS classes along with this one and have a full-time job to pay my bills for the time being. I also spent most of the week preparing a schedule to ensure that I do not go insane with everything going on in my life.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is Amazon not delivering my textbooks in time and the money to buy all of them. Thankfully this class does not start on the second book until about the 8th week of the semester so I did not have to spend as much as I thought I would. Also, even though it is not a strong feeling, I can feel a sort of 'senioritis' kicking in. I only have two semesters left of school and I am just wanting to rush through them and get it over with. I need to control that and not let it get the best of me. 

## What will I do next week?
Next week I hope to find a group to work with so we can map out a schedule to work on the project as well as work on the projects for my other classes to stay ahead of the game. At some point I still have to go watch the new Star Wars movie, maybe I can go next week, not sure yet. 

## What is my experience of the class? 
Unfortunately, since I was unsure of whether or not I would be in this class I did not attend lectures. However, if it is anything like OOP I am sure there was lots of learning and people being called on to give a simple answer but, because Downing is the one asking, all of a sudden the answer becomes foggy and the person answering is now incapable of performing basic arithmetic. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?

As mentioned in my _about_ page, I enjoy playing video games when I have free time. An all-time classic for me is Starcraft: Brood War. Yes, I pre-ordered the Remastered version and stayed up far too late playing when it released. Well, [Games & Simulations Research Group](http://gas.fel.cvut.cz/) has created a running version of the [game](https://github.com/Games-and-Simulations/sc-docker) inside a Docker container using Wine. Projects like this one leave me in awe of the power that containers have and the portability they add to applications.

title: It's A Wrap
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I have been spending it with my team mainly discussing how we are going to handle the user stories given to us by the other group. I have also been spending a good amount of time trying to figure out mocha testing. When parsing our .js files it seems to have a problem with lambda functions and certain keywords. I still have to debug some things with it. I was also able to containerize both the back-end and the front-end to make the site portable.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is the mountain of bugs that can come with npm packages. It seems that when you get a bug in a package a fix is to get another package, which then can have a bug in it as well. This has caused me to spiral into installing npm packages left and right. What I want to do now is extremely simplify my tests and purge the packages that I installed but are not helping at all.

## What will I do next week?
Next week the plan is to put mocha testing on the back-burner so that I can focus on refactoring the back end code to make sure that it is getting done. I am not hopeful with getting mocha to actually work with our code by Thursday. After refactoring and before moving back to mocha I am going to double check the user stories given to us by the other group to ensure that we finish all of them and keep the conversation going with them.

## What is my experience of the class?
Now that the website is finished and realize all the work that we actually got done and all the tools we have learned and utilized I feel like I learned really useful stuff, whether directly or indirectly. The fact that we are doing this with a group of five people has also been really rewarding. Learning off of each other and having to coordinate our work to ensure we meet deadlines is definitely going to help me in my future. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be to never spiral into installing npm packages to fix a bug in another. Instead try to fix the bug in the current packages and see if it may be a bug in your code instead. If that package has a bug that is too big for your project simply remove the package and try to find another one that works. But do not fix bugs with more packages, it is going to end up costing you more in the end.

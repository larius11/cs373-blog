## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent it working on a project or homework assignment each day. It was definitely stressful and I did not get much sleep but everything got turned in on time. I was also able to spend a good amount of time catching up on the readings and doing some research for my Global Development class. Towards the end of the week, after all my assignments were turned in I even managed to get my taxes done! The last pressing matter on my agenda is getting my car inspected. 

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is, as always, time. All of my classes have a test/midterm coming up in two weeks and I am having to study for all of them at the same time. Although it's nice that they are not assigning much homework and I can actually focus on studying, the fact that they are all happening at the same time is causing the study material to pile up and be a bit overwhelming. I believe that if I plan out at least 3 hours of study time for each test I will be okay. I do not feel particularly lost in any class so a broad review of what I've learned in each class should be enough to do well. Having said that, I do feel worried about the HackerRank test in this class. Last year I took OOP with Downing and the last version of a HackerRank test that I experienced was not a pleasant one.

## What will I do next week?
Next week the plan is to finish the little homework that I have assigned early so that I can focus on keeping up with my studying and not fall behind on any of the material. I hope to have a schedule planned out by Monday so I allow myself to not be overwhelmed by everything that needs to be done. My group for this class has decided to meet on Thursday to discuss how we are going to go about tackling the next section of our project. One thing I decided to focus on before we meet up is setting up docker on our AWS instance. I created a separate instance than the one that is hosting our server so that the production website is online in case the graders happen to be checking it at the same time that I am messing with something.

## What is my experience of the class?
So far, my experience of the class has been extremely rewarding. I have used DigitalOcean to host a server before but had no idea that you could host one for much cheaper using AWS. I am also glad to be able to mess with Flask, it makes routing and dynamic page loading really easy. Although, I am not too thrilled about the performance, hopefully, adding a docker container helps out with that. As for the quizzes, compared to OOP, they are much more relaxed. We have had more attendance quizzes than I thought we would ever have. This makes the class less stressful, and I enjoy that.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week for this blog entry has to be to set up your flask environment as you are coming up with your idea for the project. Do not delay figuring out how it is that your website is going to be dishing out its data to the users. Our current deployment randomly decides to crash and we are having to restart the server every now and then to ensure that the website is up for the graders. Other groups implemented a docker container within their server that handles these errors, had we noticed them earlier we could have done the same.

## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent it trying to keep up with all the work that was due this past week and the work that is going to be due in the upcoming week. I was also preparing two projects for other classes that I am taking. With all the chaos that came with turning in project #3, I had to rework my schedule in order to accommodate other work I need to do.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is the fact that our website has bugs that are keeping it from displaying cleanly and the database is a bit messy and files need to be cleaned up. All this needs to be done while I also keep up with my other classes and work my 40 hour work week. It is getting to the point in the semester where everything seems a bit overwhelming. Another thing that is in my way is lack of sleep. While trying to catch up on everything that I need to do I have been losing a lot of sleep and that is making me tired throughout the day. Thankfully this weekend I have been able to catch up on some of that sleep.

## What will I do next week?
Next week the plan is to clean up the files for the database and the front end of our website in order to start the next phase in a clean and collected manner. Once all of that is working the next phase should not be as difficult as the one we just finished. I also have to write a rough draft of a research paper for one of my classes. Once all of that is done I have to figure out some way to celebrate my sisters birthday on the 30th, or at least sometime around there. 

## What is my experience of the class?
My experience of the class has changed from the way it started. As we get through more sections of the project it definitely feels more like a job as a WebDev instead of the feeling of an all-around Software Developer. However, seeing how multiple languages (JS, Python, SQL) can all work together to pump out a powerful application with useful data is quite rewarding. So far, I am loving this class.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would have to be to focus on creating skeleton code for the project you are working on. My group and I lost some time focusing on some details for the database that ended up putting us behind during Spring Break and forced us to cram a lot of work this past week.

title: A team and interesting schedules.
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I have spent it scheduling time with my group to meet up and work on the project. We got the project well on its' way and are moving along at a decent pace. I was also able to finish a writing assignment that I had due for one of my classes. However, focusing on these projects has made me fall off on some of the homework assignments that I have due at the beginning of the week coming up.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is matching my schedule with the schedule of my team to ensure that we get the project finished. I do not have much free time and I have been trying really hard to focus 100% of my attention to the project when we meet up and that has caused me to lose focus on my other classes. I need to rethink my schedule with team meetups in mind. I am also not as comfortable as I think I should be with the AWS server we are handling, so I would love to spend some time getting used to the interface and how it works.

## What will I do next week?
Next week my plan is to get the project for this class done early so I can spend the rest of the week catching up on the homework I am falling behind on. This includes the reading for various classes including this one. Maybe on Thursday after we turn the project in I'll spend the night reading up on material I am currently missing. I am curious, is everyone else finding enough time to do all of the readings for the class? I would also like to spend some free time with my team, maybe go get some food or something, just to disconnect from the stress of school for a little bit.

## What is my experience of the class?
So far my experience of the class is wonderful but stressful. Having to incorporate all of these tools into one big project seems daunting and can be overwhelming if it is not divided up into sections. If it was not for the readings and the various discussions we have had about pair programming, user stories, and overall set up of big projects I would be completely lost with setting up the project. It is also nice that we are in big groups of 5 so that all our strengths make up for all of our weaknesses. I am excited to see the final product our team will produce.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
For my tip-of-the-week, I will definitely have to talk about how important it is to be proactive about finding a team for the final project. The more people you ask the more schedules you can find that may work best with what you got going on in your life. Also, do not be afraid to say no, and do not take it personally when someone says no to you. We all have different things going on, and if something does not feel right, it is much better to say no than to end up having to drag the team down because you cannot meet when everyone else is working.

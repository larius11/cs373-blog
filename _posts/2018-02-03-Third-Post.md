title: Ahead Of The Game.
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent it finishing up projects and trying to stay ahead so I do not get overwhelmed with stuff to do. I had been behind on readings so I was able to take care of that as well as finishing up all the projects that were due. I even had enough spare time to get in some streaming a little bit of Overwatch and Fallout 4 on Twitch this weekend. It was nice being able to enjoy some free time without worrying about having to finish some stuff up.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is the temptation to keep enjoying my free time playing games and streaming instead of focusing on my responsibilities. I think stating it clearly in my head and keeping up with my schedule will help me steer away from wasting my time and staying on track. The fact that I have been staying ahead of the game has been extremely helpful so far, I just have to make sure that I do not fall behind.

## What will I do next week?
This upcoming week my plan is to spend all the weekdays in a productive manner to ensure that I keep ahead of all of my projects. The plan is to leave all of the gaming activities for the weekend and maintaining a schedule that allows me to sleep. I also need to start looking for a group to begin the final project. The main concern with me is having a working schedule with 5 other people.

## What is my experience of the class?
So far my experience of the class is similar to the experience I had in Professor Downing's OOP class. I like that he has added some class time to actually using HackerRank to get used to the UI and how to turn in code through the website. It is a useful tool that exposes us to actual code that we can compile and run and is a great way to assess our understanding of the concepts we are covering in class.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
For my tip-of-the-week, I recommend reading this [post](https://www.freelancinggig.com/blog/2018/01/26/github-vs-bitbucket-need-know/) which compares Github and Bitbucket and their different uses. It does so in a sort of round-by-round comparisons in which Bitbucket or Github come out as winners so that their individual strengths are highlighted, overall an interesting read.
